# 📚 Libft – 42 School Project

Libft is one of the first and most fundamental projects at 42. Its main goal is to have the student create their **own C library** by reimplementing several standard C functions and developing additional utility functions from scratch.

---

## 📌 Main Objectives

- Recreate functions from `<ctype.h>`, `<string.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, etc.
- Learn how to work with pointers, arrays, strings, and memory in C.
- Gain a deep understanding of how basic C functions work.
- Write clean, modular, and reusable code.
- Build a foundation that will be used in many future projects.

---

## 🧱 Project Structure

The library is usually split into three parts:

### 1. Libc Functions (mandatory)

Reimplementations of standard functions such as:

- `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strncmp`
- `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_bzero`
- `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_toupper`, etc.

### 2. Additional Functions (also mandatory)

New helpful functions like:

- `ft_substr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_split`
- `ft_itoa`, `ft_strmapi`, `ft_strtrim`

### 3. Bonus Functions (optional for full score)

Linked list manipulation:

- `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstlast`, `ft_lstclear`, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

- All function names must be prefixed with `ft_`.
- Only `malloc`, `free`, and `write` are allowed from the standard library.
- Each function must be in its own `.c` file.
- A working `Makefile` is required.
- Code must follow the **42 Norm (Norminette)**.

---

## 📘 Conclusion

`Libft` acts as a **personal C toolkit**, essential for all upcoming 42 projects.
It teaches discipline, good coding practices, and provides a solid understanding of C programming fundamentals.
